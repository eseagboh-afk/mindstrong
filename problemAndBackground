Why MindStrong is Necessary




Problem Background and Definition 

Mental health resources are expensive. Navigating low cost/free solutions can be overwhelming and confusing. Affordable resources are rightly prioritized for individuals who are an immediate danger to themselves and others. 

Social stigmas related to mental health often deter people from publicly seeking support. These social stigmas may also condition individuals to view mental health resources as something reserved for the “mentally-ill.” People thus fail to recognize that consistent mental health awareness and proper monitoring of one’s affect is necessary for everyone, even those who may claim to be mentally sound. 

Individuals who do want to seek out mental health resources are sometimes unsure of where to start. They may seek out resources related to a specific life event (e.g, death of a loved one, breakup, loss of a job, etc). This leads to event specific therapy/treatment. Event-specific mental health resources may not address other lifestyle factors that may be impacting an individual’s well-being.

MindStrong provides a mental health solution for the general population. It takes in user reported lifestyle data. With consent of the user, MindStrong can also pull data from FitBit and Oura. MindStrong uses this data to provide a comprehensive analysis on the correlation between a user’s current lifestyle and their overall mood/affect. Users can use the information provided by MindStrong to find resources that will contribute to the growth of their mental health. It’s important to note that MindStrong will contain margins for error, as the bulk of data ingested is subjective and dependent on the consistency and transparency of the user.
